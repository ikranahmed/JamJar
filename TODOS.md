Hey char so i just NOW got out of the class with aaron at midnight. But for your tutoring session tomorrow ignore everything i told you earlier that you need to do. We have more important things to get working that are working from the localhost right now which is wrong


KeChara ToDo for tutoring session:

-get delete playlist button to work with graphql
- add delete button to song ( when clicked its going to call the REMOVE_SONG mutation


Those 4 things are the most important things we need to work on immediately we are not using a myplaylist page anymore because aaron said that will be way more hard work bc we dont have our graphqls working correctly
